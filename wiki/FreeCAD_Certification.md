# FreeCAD Certification
## Background

In the forum a [post](https://forum.freecadweb.org/viewtopic.php?f=8&t=31408) was made in regards to a FreeCAD Certification Exam that could rate the proficiency of users. In comparison to other CAD software, specifically in this case: CREO, in which educational/corporate institutions utilize. The idea was then floated about having the same thing for FC.

## Sections of the Exam 

### Terminology

-   List of CAD/CAM terms that the user explain in their own words

:   

    :   Parametric, Constraint, Fillet, Chamfer\...etc..

### Workbench Proficiency 

-   What workbench(s) would you use to do X with a Y and Z ?
-   Explain the differences between different workbenches ? (ex. Part vs PartDesign)
-   How many creative methodologies (different ways to achieve the same result) would you employ to do the following etc..etc.. ?

### Troubleshooting

-   Throw some errors at the user to see if they understand what is the problem with the model
-   Show a forked dependency graph and ask how the user would fix it
-   Show a topological naming issue and ask the user how to fix it

### Python API (optional) 

-   Ask user to code models using python only
-   Ask user to solve an issue by extrapolating values from the model using python

### Demonstration

-   Choose some models out of the [100 CAD Exercises](https://forum.freecadweb.org/viewtopic.php?f=3&t=31006&p=259508) forum thread and have the user demonstrate their work (on a web-based FC instance? Or maybe they can screencast their attempts and upload to Youtube or something?)
