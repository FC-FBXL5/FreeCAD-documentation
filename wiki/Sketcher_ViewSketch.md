## Description

This tool sets the model view perpendicular to the sketch plane. It is useful when the user has changed the model view orientation to examine another aspect of the model and wants to return to a view normal to the sketch.

## Usage

While in sketch edit mode, either

-   Click on the **<img src=images/Sketcher_ViewSketch.svg style="width:16px"> [View Sketch](Sketcher_ViewSketch.md)** icon in the Sketcher or Part Design toolbar, or
-   Go to the {{MenuCommand|Sketch → <img src=images/Sketcher_ViewSketch.svg style="width:16px"> View sketch}} menu.
