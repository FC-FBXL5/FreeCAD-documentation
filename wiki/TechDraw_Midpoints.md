## Description

The Midpoints tool adds Cosmetic [Vertices](Glossary#V.md) at the midpoints of one or more Edges.

*Cosmetic Vertices at midpoints of Edges*

## Usage

1.  Select one or more Edges in a View.
2.  Press the **<img src="images/TechDraw_Midpoints.svg" width=16px> Add Midpoint Vertices** button
3.  Cosmetic Vertices will be added at the mid-point(s) of the Edge(s).

To delete a Midpoint, select it and use the toolbar button **<img src="images/TechDraw_CosmeticEraser.svg" width=16px> [Remove Cosmetic Object](TechDraw_CosmeticEraser.md)**.

## Properties

Cosmetic Vertices have no properties of their own, as they are not Document Objects. They share color and size settings with regular geometry vertices.

## Scripting

See also: [Autogenerated API documentation](https://freecad.github.io/SourceDoc/) and [FreeCAD Scripting Basics](FreeCAD_Scripting_Basics.md).

Cosmetic Vertices are not accessible from [macros](Macros.md) or the [Python](Python.md) console at this time. This snippet will remove all Cosmetic Vertices from the View.

 
```python
>>> v = App.ActiveDocument.View
>>> v.clearCV()
>>> App.activeDocument().recompute()
```
