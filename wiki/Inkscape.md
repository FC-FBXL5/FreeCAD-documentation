# Inkscape
Inkscape is a free and open-source vector graphics editor used to create vector images, primarily in Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) format. Other formats can be imported and exported ([wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inkscape)).

Inkscape can be used in conjunction with the [TechDraw Workbench](TechDraw_Workbench.md) to customize or fix broken SVG formatting.
