# Development roadmap/pt
**Important: many of these roadmaps are not up to date or perhaps abandoned. This page and the pages it links to most likely contain obsolete info. A 'soft' roadmap can be found on the [http://www.freecadweb.org/tracker/roadmap_page.php bugtracker] but for now there isn't a 'hard' roadmap. There are many efforts going on simultaneously.**

FreeCAD - though usable in many applications - is at the beginning of a long journey into CAD mainstream. There is still a lot to do to reach a state where we can compete with commercial software.

This section gives an overview of what is planned and gives you the opportunity to participate or give your opinion. As we are volunteers to FreeCAD we have only a certain amount of time. So if you interested in one of the topics and willing to help, just let us know! We use the [Getting Things Done (GTD)](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Getting_Things_Done#Methodology) style for the project document. Here is the [Project template](Project_template.md).

-   The [Organization chart](Organization_chart.md) shows who does what in the FreeCAD universe.
-   You can follow issues that are currently being worked on via the bugtracker here: <http://www.freecadweb.org/tracker/roadmap_page.php>

## Release schedule 

Like in the most [FLOSS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/FLOSS) projects a release schedule is very rough. There will be no fixed dates and **\"It\'s done, when it\'s done!\"**

-   The [Release process](Release_process.md) page gather ideas for a more efficient release workflow
