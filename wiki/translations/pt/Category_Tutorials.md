FreeCAD tutorials. Please help us adding more!

Special pages are [Offsite tutorials/pt](Offsite_tutorials/pt.md) and [Video tutorials/pt](Video_tutorials/pt.md) that hierarchically contain links to tutorials hosted on external sites. A useful source of video tutorials is of course also a *FreeCAD* keyword search on [YouTube](http://YouTube.com).
