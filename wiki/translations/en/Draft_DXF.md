## Description

Draft DXF is a software module used by the <img alt="" src=images/Std_Open.svg  style="width:24px;"> _ and <img alt="" src=images/Std_Export.svg  style="width:24px;"> [Std Export](Std_Export.md) commands to handle the DXF file format.

## Importing

Two importers are available, which one is used can be specified under **Edit → Preferences... → Import-Export → DXF**. One is built-in, C++-based and fast, the other is legacy, coded in Python, slower, and requires the installation of an add-on, but can handle some entities better and can create more refined FreeCAD objects. Both support all DXF versions starting from R12.

3D solids inside a DXF file are stored under a binary ACIS/SAT blob, which at the moment cannot be read by FreeCAD.

### C++ importer 

This importer can import the following DXF objects:

-   lines
-   polylines (and lwpolylines)
-   arcs
-   circles
-   ellipses
-   splines
-   points
-   texts and mtexts
-   dimensions
-   leaders
-   blocks (only geometry, texts, dimensions and attributes inside blocks are skipped)
-   layers
-   paper space objects

### Legacy importer 

This importer can import the following DXF objects:

-   lines
-   polylines (and lwpolylines)
-   arcs
-   circles
-   ellipses
-   splines
-   3D faces
-   texts and mtexts
-   leaders
-   layers

## Exporting

There are also two exporters. The legacy exporter exports to the R12 DXF format, the C++ exporter to the R14 DXF format. Both formats can be handled by many applications.

### C++ exporter 

Some of the features and limitations of this exporter are:

-   All FreeCAD 2D geometry is exported, except [Draft CubicBezCurves](Draft_CubicBezCurve.md), [Draft BezCurves](Draft_BezCurve.md) and [Draft Points](Draft_Point.md).
-   Straight edges from faces of 3D objects are exported, but curved edges only if they are on a plane parallel to the XY plane of the global coordinate system. Note that a DXF created from 3D objects will contain duplicate lines.
-   Texts and dimensions are not exported.
-   Colors are ignored.
-   Layers are mapped from object names.

### Legacy exporter 

Some of the features and limitations of this exporter are:

-   All FreeCAD 2D geometry is exported, except [Draft Points](Draft_Point.md). But ellipses, B-splines and Bézier curves are not exported properly.
-   3D objects are exported as flattened 2D views.
-   Compound objects are exported as blocks.
-   Texts and dimensions are exported.
-   The colors in the DXF are based on the line color of objects. Black is mapped to \"ByBlock\", other colors are mapped using AutoCAD Color Index (ACI) colors.
-   Layers are mapped from layer and group names. When groups are nested, the deepest group gives the layer name.

## Installing

For licensing reasons, the required _.

## Preferences

See [Import Export Preferences](Import_Export_Preferences.md).

## Scripting

See also: _.

To export objects to DXF use the `export` method of the importDXF module.


```python
importDXF.export(objectslist, filename, nospline=False, lwPoly=False)
```

-   For the Windows OS: use a {{FileName|/}} (forward slash) as the path separator in {{Incode|filename}}.

Example:


```python
import FreeCAD as App
import Draft
import importDXF

doc = App.newDocument()

polygon1 = Draft.make_polygon(3, radius=500)
polygon2 = Draft.make_polygon(5, radius=1500)

doc.recompute()

objects = [polygon1, polygon2]
importDXF.export(objects, "/home/user/Pictures/myfile.dxf")
```
