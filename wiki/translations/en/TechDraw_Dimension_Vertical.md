## Description

The Dimension Vertical tool adds a vertical dimension to a View. The dimension may be between two vertices, the length of one edge or the vertical distance between 2 edges. The distance will initially be the projected distance (ie as shown on the drawing), but this may be changed to the actual 3D distance using the **<img src="images/TechDraw_Dimension_Link.svg" width=16px> [Link Dimension](TechDraw_Dimension_Link.md)** tool.

*Length dimension taken from two arbitrary nodes of the view; the distance is measured vertically*

## Usage

1.  Select the points or edge which define your measurement.
2.  Press the **<img src="images/TechDraw_Dimension_Vertical.svg" width=16px> [Dimension Vertical](TechDraw_Dimension_Vertical.md)** button
3.  A dimension will be added to the View. The dimension may be dragged to the desired position.
4.  If needed, add tolerances as described in [this page](TechDraw_Geometric_dimensioning_and_tolerancing#Tolerances.md).

To change the properties of a dimension object either double-clicking it in the drawing or in the [Tree view](Tree_view.md). This will open the [dimension dialog](TechDraw_Dimension_Length#Dimension_dialog.md).

## Limitations

Dimension objects are vulnerable to \"[topological naming](Topological_naming_problem.md)\" issues. See the information in the [TechDraw Dimension Length](TechDraw_Dimension_Length.md) tool for more information.

## Properties

This object has the same properties as the [TechDraw Dimension Length](TechDraw_Dimension_Length.md) tool. See that tool for details.

## Scripting


**See also:**

[TechDraw API](TechDraw_API.md) and [FreeCAD Scripting Basics](FreeCAD_Scripting_Basics.md).

The Dimension Vertical tool can be used in [macros](Macros.md) and from the [Python](Python.md) console by using the following functions:


```python
dim1 = FreeCAD.ActiveDocument.addObject('TechDraw::DrawViewDimension','Dimension')
dim1.Type = "DistanceX"
dim1.References2D=[(view1, 'Edge1')]
rc = page.addView(dim1)
```
