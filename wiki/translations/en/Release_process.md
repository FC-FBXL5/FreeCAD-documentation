 The aim of this page is to gather ideas and organize things so official releases of FreeCAD require less work, and therefore can happen more often. This topic is discussed on this [forum thread](http://forum.freecadweb.org/viewtopic.php?f=8&t=6441).

## General ideas {#general_ideas}

-   The \"target release\" field of the [tracker](http://www.freecadweb.org/tracker) should be used more, even on bugs that are not assigned to anybody, to mark bugs that we find important to solve before a release, or features we are working on, so others are aware of \"how close\" we are to release. This appears on the [roadmap](http://freecadweb.org/tracker/roadmap_page.php).

-   We should find a way to process the list below (A \"tickable\" list somewhere?)

## Planning

-   Ideally official releases should happen each 3 to 6 months
-   A signal should be emitted (by [jriegel](User:Jriegel.md)?) before the release (3 weeks?) so:
    -   No more new feature gets introduced, only bug fixes
    -   The strings are collected and uploaded to crowdin for translation
    -   The documentation can be fully updated
    -   The release notes can be prepared/finished
