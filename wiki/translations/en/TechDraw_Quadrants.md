# TechDraw Quadrants/en

## Description

The Quadrant tool adds [Cosmetic Vertices](TechDraw_CosmeticVertex.md) at the 90/180/270° points of a circular edge. The 0° vertex should already be there as a geometric vertex.

## Usage

1.  Select one or more (circular) Edges in a View.
2.  Press the **<img src="images/TechDraw_Quadrants.svg" width=16px> Add Quadrant Vertices** button.
3.  Cosmetic vertices will be added at the quarter-points of the edges.

**Note:** This tool can be used on any edge, not just circles.

To delete a Quadrant Vertex, select it and use the toolbar button **<img src="images/TechDraw_CosmeticEraser.svg" width=16px> [Remove Cosmetic Object](TechDraw_CosmeticEraser.md)**.

## Properties

Cosmetic Vertices have no properties of their own, as they are not Document Objects. They share color and size settings with regular geometry vertices.

## Scripting

See also: [Autogenerated API documentation](https://freecad.github.io/SourceDoc/) and [FreeCAD Scripting Basics](FreeCAD_Scripting_Basics.md).

Cosmetic Vertices are not accessible from [macros](Macros.md) or the [Python](Python.md) console at this time. This snippet will remove all Cosmetic Vertices from the View.


```python
>>> v = App.ActiveDocument.View
>>> v.clearCV()
>>> App.activeDocument().recompute()
```
