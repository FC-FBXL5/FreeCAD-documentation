If there are any tangential faces attached to the face you wish to apply draft to, it will fail. A common cause of failure is attempting to apply draft to a face that already has a fillet or chamfer applied to it. In this case, remove the tangential surface, apply the draft as need, then re-apply the fillet or chamfer. |
