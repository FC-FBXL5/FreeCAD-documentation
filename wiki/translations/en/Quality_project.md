This is the project plan of the Quality project as part of the [Development roadmap](Development_roadmap.md).

## Purpose and principles 

This project is partial a software development and a documentation project. It aims to raise the quality of the main components of FreeCAD and delivers a better experience to the first FreeCAD contact.

## Outcome

<img alt="" src=images/HelpViewer.jpg  style="width:150px;">

One important step is the **Complete** workbench which is the starting workbench for the average user (if there is one). The complete workbench hold all Commands and Features from all the modules and workbenches which met certain **[ quality criteria](Gui_Command#Quality_requirements.md)**. That will hide away the stormy development and half implemented features from the user which wants just model.

Another important outcome is a complete **help system** for all Commands and Features at least in the Complete workbench. That mean a help page like [Draft ShapeString](Draft_ShapeString.md) exist for all in the [List of Commands](List_of_Commands.md).

## Brainstorming
