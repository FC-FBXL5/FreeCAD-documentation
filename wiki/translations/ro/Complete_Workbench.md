# Complete Workbench/ro
**The [[Complete Workbench]] is deprecated.**

<img alt="" src=images/Workbench_Complete.svg  style="width:64px;">

This workbench is empty. It used to hold all commands that were implemented and considered \"complete\" in FreeCAD. Since then the number of commands has grown far beyond the possibility to hold them all in one workbench. The commands are now structured in the different [workbenches](workbenches.md).

See [Interface Customization](Interface_Customization.md) if you\'d like to adapt FreeCAD to your own needs, like creating custom toolbars with the tools and commands that you want.
