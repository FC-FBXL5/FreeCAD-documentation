*Simplified diagram of the relationships between the core objects in the program. The `App::Link* object is a core component of the system, it does not depend on any workbench, but it can be used with most objects created in all workbenches.`

## Utilização

1.  Select an object in the [tree view](tree_view.md) or [3D view](3D_view.md) for which you wish to create a Link.
2.  Press the **<img src=images/Std_LinkMake.svg style="width:16px"> [Std LinkMake](Std_LinkMake.md)** button. The produced object has the same icon as the original object, but has an arrow overlay indicating it is a Link.

See the [Std LinkMake](Std_LinkMake.md) page for the complete information, including its use in [Scripting](Std_LinkMake#Scripting.md).
