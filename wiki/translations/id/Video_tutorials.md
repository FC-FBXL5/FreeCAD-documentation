# Video tutorials/id
**Please pay attention to the version of FreeCAD used in the tutorial. If a tutorial uses an older version of the program, the general modelling process may still work but some tools may have changed in newer releases. Do not add videos made with version 0.16 or older, as these releases are considered obsolete.**

This page presents a selection of video tutorials made by FreeCAD users and developers. Visit the [Tutorials and videos](https://forum.freecadweb.org/viewforum.php?f=36) subforum for more links. A useful source of video tutorials is [YouTube](https://YouTube.com).

Some more advanced instructions include how to do logo design, metal bending, and assembly. Most videos describe FreeCAD 0.16, but since they don\'t focus on modelling aspects, the information is generally applicable for other versions.

## Outdated videos 


**In FreeCAD 0.17 the [PartDesign Workbench](PartDesign_Workbench.md) received important updates that change the way solids are created with respect to previous versions. New users should watch videos for versions 0.17 and above to understand the concept of working with a [PartDesign Body](PartDesign_Body.md) and datum objects.**


**These videos are considered obsolete because they use v0.16 or earlier versions of the program.**

Although these videos are considered obsolete, they are included here for historical reference as the information they contain may still be useful for intermediate and advanced users. Absolute beginners are advised to avoid these videos until they have a better understanding of various modelling techniques.
