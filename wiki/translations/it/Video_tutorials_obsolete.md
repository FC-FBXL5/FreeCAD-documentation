# Video tutorials obsolete/it
**In FreeCAD 0.17 the [PartDesign Workbench](PartDesign_Workbench.md) received important updates that change the way solids are created with respect to previous versions. New users should watch videos for versions 0.17 and above to understand the concept of working with a [PartDesign Body](PartDesign_Body.md) and datum objects.** **These videos are considered obsolete because they use v0.16 or earlier versions of the program.**

## Introduction

Although these videos are considered obsolete, they are included here for historical reference as the information they contain may still be useful for intermediate and advanced users. Absolute beginners are advised to avoid these videos until they have a better understanding of various modelling techniques.

For up-to-date videos on different topics, see the [video tutorials](video_tutorials.md) page, and also [tutorials](tutorials.md) for written tutorials. A complete, unsorted list of tutorials can be found in [:Category:Tutorials](:Category:Tutorials.md).
