## Описание

Hydrostatics computation is a critical stage of a ship\'s design, it provides an understanding to the underlying principal stability hull parameters. Hydrostatics are mandatory data for classification societies certificates ship, coupled with loading condition data (weights and gravity position) provides essential data about ship stability. The Ship workbench provides a tool to obtain main hydrostatics curves.

## Usage

When the Hydrostatics tool is executed, a task dialog is shown. Usually Hydrostatics curves are presented for each trim angle.
