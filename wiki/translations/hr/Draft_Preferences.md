# Draft Preferences/hr










{{TOCright}}

The preferences for the [Draft Workbench](Draft_Workbench.md) are found in the [Preferences Editor](Preferences_Editor.md), in the menu **Edit → Preferences → Draft**.

There are four tabs: General settings, Grid and snapping, Visual settings, and Texts and dimensions.

## General settings 

General settings allows you to set certain basic properties like the default [working plane](Draft_SelectPlane.md), the name and color of the [construction group](Draft_ToggleConstructionMode.md), a prefix to use for the [Draft Clones](Draft_Clone.md), and the internal precision of the calculations.

## Grid and snapping 

Grid and snapping allows you to set properties of the **<img src="images/Draft_ToggleGrid.svg" width=16px> [visible grid](Draft_ToggleGrid.md)**, which can be used with the [Draft Snap](Draft_Snap.md) methods.

By default the option \"Always snap (disable snap mod)\" is active, which means that you don\'t need to press a modifier key to activate the snapping tools. If this option is not active, you must press a modifier key to activate snapping.

You can set three modifiers:

-    **Shift**constraint modifier, to [constraint](Draft_Constrain.md) the movement of the cursor along the X, Y, or Z axis.

-    **Ctrl**snap modifier, to snap the cursor to specific modes given by [Draft Snap](Draft_Snap.md).

-    **Alt**alternative modifier, to activate an alternative function for a Draft tool.

You can specify the space between each grid line, between each major line, and the total number of lines displayed in the working plane.

## Visual settings 

Visual settings allows you to specify the default line color and width for new objects, and the color of the [Draft Snap](Draft_Snap.md) symbols. By clicking the \"Save current color and linewidth across sessions\" checkbox, changes made in the [Draft Tray](Draft_Tray.md) will be saved and restored the next time you open FreeCAD.

## Texts and dimensions 

Texts and dimensions allows you to set default properties for the [Draft Text](Draft_Text.md), [Draft Dimension](Draft_Dimension.md), and [Draft ShapeString](Draft_ShapeString.md) tools, including default font and size, and style and size of the dimension lines. These properties can be changed in the individual text objects as well.
