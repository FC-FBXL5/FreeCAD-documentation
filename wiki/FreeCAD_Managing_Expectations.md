# FreeCAD Managing Expectations
## Purpose

 

The purpose of this wiki page is to \'Manage Expectations\' of users using FreeCAD, especially those coming from other proprietary CAD/CAM solutions.

## The Eternal Open Source Conundrum 

I really like/dislike using \[Insert your go-to proprietary program\] but I:

-   can\'t afford it
-   resent that I need to pay for it
-   don\'t want to be locked in to proprietary format/technology
-   want to own my work
-   want to work on my local machine (not on someone else\'s cloud)
-   really like using FOSS better
-   don\'t want to be involved in a FOSS because I don\'t have: time, skills the community needs
-   don\'t want to involved in a FOSS because someone else is probably doing that
-   want to complain somewhere about a pathetic attempt at competing with \[Insert your go-to proprietary program\]
-   want to vent about how ugly the UI is to someone/somewhere just because wanna!

### Reflections

-   How do people conceive the way open source software is created?
-   Do people expect that when a group of people with common interest come together that they will magically self-organize in to a highly productive and well-oiled machine? (see [tweet](https://twitter.com/rickhanlonii/status/1231585270966951936))

## What FreeCAD is not 

### Non Parametric 

### Mesh Modeler 

## Common Perspectives 

### FreeCAD has not reached v1.0 

### FreeCAD is not stable 

### FreeCAD UI is ugly 

### Where is my favorite feature? 

## Realities

### OpenCascade Kernel 

A core external dependency that FreeCAD is utterly dependent on. There are ATM no FreeCAD devs that have any upstream interaction on the OpenCascade code.

### Qt

### Volunteers

Timelines, unpaid\... it\'s done when it\'s done.

### History

FreeCAD\'s history along with departures (jriegel) and pivots (PartDesign Next, App:Link etc\...)
