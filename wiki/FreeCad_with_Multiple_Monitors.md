## My Environment 

## FreeCad can Span Multiple Monitors 

When FreeCad is not maximized it can be resized to span 2 Monitors. This lets you use 2 monitors but only rearrange the components within the FreeCad window. Some components tend to stick to the sides.

## Some Components Can Break Out 

Some components can break out of the FreeCad window and be place anywhere in you monitor space.

-   ComboView
