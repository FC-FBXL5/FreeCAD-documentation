# <img alt="" src=images/preferences-techdraw.svg  style="width:64px;">  TechDraw Roadmap

The [TechDraw Workbench](TechDraw_Workbench.md) was introduced officially as part of FreeCAD in version 0.17.

Here is a rough roadmap of areas to be addressed in the future (in no particular order).

### Current Activity 

-   v0.20 release preparation - linux display problems [6698](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/issues/6698)

### Upcoming

These items have working code in the development environment and will be implemented early in the v0.21 development cycle.

-   Navigation modes
-   New face detection algorithm
-   PrintAll function
-   Bitmap hatching [6582](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/issues/6582)
-   Extension line gaps [6774](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/issues/6774)
-   Section dialog live/deferred update option
-   Convert all templates to \"plain svg\"
-   View stacking order [6012](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/issues/6012)

These items have semi-working code or are well defined and will be implemented at some point in the v0.21 cycle.

-   Projection group dialog upgrade including live/deferred update option
-   Expanded dimension dialog that includes ability to update 2d and 3d references. Possible retirement of current \"Link Dimension\" function.
-   Ability to specify file preferences as relative paths [6707](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/issues/6707)

These items are expected to be in v0.21, but have not been analyzed in detail.

-   ability to specify units by dimension or page instead of system wide.
-   weld symbol upgrades including ISO/AWS symbology and help text [6313](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/issues/6313)

These items are candidates for v0.21, but require investigation

-   ordinate dimensions [6587](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/issues/6587)
-   broken view [5694](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/issues/5694)
-   improved handling of Draft/Arch objects
-   include sketcher points in drawings

There are a number of smaller feature requests that will probably be implemented in v0.21, possibly as macros.
