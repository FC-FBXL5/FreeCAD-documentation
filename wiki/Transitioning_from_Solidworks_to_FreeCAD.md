# Transitioning from Solidworks to FreeCAD
{{FYI}}


{{TOCright}}

## Overview

The intention of this page is to serve as a guide for users that are accustomed to the Solidworks CAD/CAM workflow and want to try, use, or perhaps migrate to FreeCAD.

## History

Understanding a little of the history of FreeCAD potentially help users comprehend and orient better to it.

-   FreeCAD was initially designed to behave parametrically using the [Constructive solid geometry](Constructive_solid_geometry.md) method (see also <img alt="" src=images/Workbench_Part.svg  style="width:24px;"> [Part Workbench](Part_Workbench.md)).
-   Later it incorporated the [feature editing](feature_editing.md) method within the <img alt="" src=images/Workbench_PartDesign.svg  style="width:24px;"> [PartDesign Workbench](PartDesign_Workbench.md).
-   Solidworks utilizes the latter approach, [feature editing](feature_editing.md).

## Tips

The Part Design Workbench has many equivalent functions to SolidWorks, though may be called by different names. The image below identifies equivalent functions and their names on each platform, as well as noting similar functions and functions that are unique to each platform: ![](images/Features_and_Part_Design.png )
