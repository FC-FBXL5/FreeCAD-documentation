# Distcc
## Description

distcc is a free distributed C/C++ compiler system. Essentially it\'s a program to distribute compilation of C or C++ code across several machines on a network. distcc should always generate the same results as a local compile, is simple to install and use, and is often two or more times faster than a local compile.

## Using Docker 

FreeCAD dev \'etrombly\' has published a short explanation on [how to install distcc to compile FreeCAD on a network of computers using Docker](https   *//forum.freecadweb.org/viewtopic.php?f=4&t=50810&p=459142#p458614).
