# A Beginner's Questions about Working on the Wiki



## Purpose of this Page 

This is a page that is a one person\'s perspective, put out for discussion of the Wiki process.

I am a fan of FreeCAD, but a frustrated one. It is easy to complain, more effort to contribute. So I would like contribute to FreeCAD, currently not by coding but by documentation. I believe that without good usable documentation the coding is much less useful.

Our manual says:

    Like most wikis, it contains huge amounts of information but is somewhat difficult to access and navigate by newcomers. 
    This makes it an excellent resource for reference, but a less practical tool for learning FreeCAD. 
    This manual will walk you through much of the information available on the wiki, but we hope the step-by-step approach based on examples 
    and a more unified tone due to a smaller number of authors will make it more suitable for a first contact with FreeCAD. 
    It will become a companion for the wiki, but not replace it. 

So to get on with it: this page is not a discussion of how to improve the documentation of FreeCAD, but a meta discussion about how to improve the documentation of working on the FreeCAD Wiki. When I better understand this I will be better prepared to work on FreeCAD documentation proper.

To make my version of this discussion concrete I will write it as if I were writing a Wiki page about the Wiki. The content is not intended to answer questions, but instead, link to the answers. In what follow I will fill in links as I discover them, else I will use Link(s) required, and if I have a link, but suspect more information would be desirable use Enough info? I have not really written this in a proposed format, just proposed content. Additionally I have written a reader\'s guide to using the wiki, I have this here because the way we write the wiki has, of course, a big impact on how it should be read.

## Possible Content for a new Meta Wiki Page 

If you are here you probably have some question about how to contribute to this Wiki, the answers of course, are in this Wiki, here is a guide: ( In the form of questions and links to the answers )

-   Do we have a guide for the user about how to use the Wiki, if so where?
    -   I have a proposal for this, if there is not a current page. **See below.**
    -   Link(s) required

-   Who can edit, how do you get permission to edit?
    -   -   **[How to get wiki editing permissions - FreeCAD Forum](https://forum.freecadweb.org/viewtopic.php?f=21&t=6830)**

-   What is style guide for the Wiki? ( This is a broad topic, so some seemingly subtopics will be listed separately )
    -   **[Help:Editing](Help:Editing.md)** Lots of information on the mechanics of editing, with notes on style on this wiki.
    -   **[WikiPages](WikiPages.md)** Seems to be the most important single page on the meta wiki. Has not had much in the way of major edit in about a year ( said Jan 2021 ), but minor edits have been active.

    -   **[Category:Documentation - FreeCAD Documentation](https://wiki.freecadweb.org/Category:Documentation)**
    -   Enough info?

    -   Enough info?

-   What is the implied or explicit quality guarantee of both direct content ( on wiki pages ), and indirect ( linked to external to the wiki ) content? How do we stop the ideal from being the enemy of the good?
    -   Link(s) required

-   Where do we store binary ( non-image ) files ( example models, non-hosted video ):

    -   Link(s) required.

-   How do we indicate a page is in process, a draft?:
    -   [GuiCommand model](GuiCommand_model.md) says:




     While the page is under construction, add the Template:UnfinishedDocu template at the top of the page by simply typing: 

-   and standard for
    -   in page toc place on right with show hide ??

## A Reader\'s Guide to this Wiki 

The plan for this is to extract to a different wiki page ( is it a page, a document, topic\.....? ). I include it here so as not to prolliferate too many sandbox pages, and because how we manage the wiki has a direct impact on how it should be read.

### A General Note on Navigation 

Wikis can be hard to read, they are a thicket of information cross linked in many directions. They are also an ever moving target as they evolve through additions, deletions, and edits. Typically a Wiki does not have a beginning or an end. There is no through line. You will have to find your way through on your own.

Fortunately Wikis do have some aids to navigation, aids that are not completely obvious. This little guide may inform you of some navigation features that you were not aware of but that can be very useful.

### Wiki Menu 

At the left of every wiki page is the master menu for the Wiki. If you have a question, check it out. It is however a bit limited, there are no subheading, but each page you go to will have more links ( or hyper links ) to related topics. We are going to assume here that you know how to use links, you have made it this far.

### Search

The Wiki has a pretty good search feature, this sort of thing should be familiar. Just remember to use it. You can also use external engines like Google Advanced Search <https://www.google.com/advanced_search> to search this or any other specific site.

### Collapsed Sections 

A section of a wiki page can be collapsed, much like code folding. Make it look like an empty section header, expand it to see the content.

### Categories

Most pages have been classified into categories, these are listed at the bottom of the page. A couple of examples:

-   The category **Tutorials** **[Category:Tutorials - FreeCAD Documentation](https://wiki.freecadweb.org/Category:Tutorials)** links to Tutorials
-   The category **Command Reference** contains the help pages of each of FreeCAD Command. **[Category:Command Reference - FreeCAD Documentation](https://wiki.freecadweb.org/Category:Command_Reference)**
-   The category **TechDraw** lists pages related to the TechDraw Workbench. **[Category:TechDraw - FreeCAD Documentation](https://wiki.freecadweb.org/Category:TechDraw)**

-   The category of all catagories **[Categories - FreeCAD Documentation](https://wiki.freecadweb.org/Special:Categories)** make link to a category of interest.

When you are reading a page on a topic, and still need more information you can try clicking ( at the bottom of the page ) on the categories to find what you want.

### What Links Here 

On every page, at the left, is a menu choice, \"What links here\", try it out. If you are reading a topic that seems useful the page that links to it may also be useful or link to other content that is.

### Table of Contents Pages 

These are pages which gather a bunch of other pages together by links to give a more linear trip thrught the Wiki. One example might be: [User hub](User_hub.md) This is the main help area for newcomers to FreeCAD

### Scratch Notes, to be Deleted 

-   If you find an error \..... dead link, language, content

-   types of pages \-\-- need to work thru all the categories

-   -   Page TOC \-\-- is user hub an example?
    -   Tutorials category Tutorials
