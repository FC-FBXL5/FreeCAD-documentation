# 0.20 Development Cycle
Development of FreeCAD 0.20 began following the tagging of [\| FreeCAD\'s 0.19 release version](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD/releases/tag/0.19) on February 25, 2021.

### Minimum supported library versions 

Development of 0.20 targets Ubuntu 18.04 LTS as the oldest [officially-supported](https://forum.freecadweb.org/viewtopic.php?p=483940#p483940) OS for compiling FreeCAD. Minimum supported infrastructure software versions are:

-   GCC 7.4
-   Clang 6.0
-   CMake 3.10
-   Python 3.6
-   Qt 5.9
-   OpenCASCADE 7.3

This version of FreeCAD is compiled requiring the C++17 standard, and all C++17 features are allowed with two exceptions:

-   std::filesystem is not well-supported by GCC 7.4 \-- continue to use boost::filesystem instead
-   std::regex is much slower than boost::regex in some important cases, so we will continue to include the Boost regex library

Developers are encouraged to review the [C++ Core Guidelines](https://isocpp.github.io/CppCoreGuidelines/CppCoreGuidelines) for modern C++ coding advice. No strict coding convention has been selected for FreeCAD, though new C++ code often conforms to the [Qt coding conventions](https://wiki.qt.io/Coding_Conventions), and new Python typically conforms to [PEP 8](https://pep8.org/).

### Features Under Development 

As volunteer-developed Open Source software it is impossible to guarantee that any particular feature will be implemented in a given time frame. Major features or modifications that developers are currently working on include:

-   Developing solutions to the [Topological naming problem](Topological_naming_problem.md)
-   Improving [Spreadsheet](Spreadsheet.md) usability and interoperability
-   Improving [OpenSCAD](http://www.openscad.org/) interoperability via the [OpenSCAD Workbench](OpenSCAD_Workbench.md): implementing missing functions and improving CSG shell generation in special cases
