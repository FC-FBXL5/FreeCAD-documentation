When questions are asked in the FC forum, helpers often post example files, this page is designed to help new users examine and get the most from these files.

Download and open the example file.

1.  Use the **Space-bar** to make the last feature invisible.
2.  Click on the **+** on the left hand side of the tree to expand all features.
3.  Go to the top of the tree(the first feature.)
4.  Select the sketch at the bottom of the expanded feature.
