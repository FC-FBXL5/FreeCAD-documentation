# Sketcher Move

## Description

Moves the selected sketch elements from one point to another, using the last selected point as reference.

 ![](images/sketcher_move.png‎ )  *The sequence of clicks is indicated by yellow arrows with numbers. Select element '''A'''; see a vector line indicated by two red lines from pivot point '''A''' pointing to mouse position number '''2'''. Move the mouse pointer to the target location '''3''' and see the element now as '''B''' autoconstrained on point '''3'''.*

## Usage

1.  Select the sketch elements for the move operation.
2.  There are several ways to invoke the command:
    -   Press the **<img src=images/Sketcher_Move.svg style="width:16px"> [Move](Sketcher_Move.md)** button in the toolbar.
    -   Use the **Ctrl** + **M** keyboard shortcut
    -   Use the **Sketch → Sketcher tools → <img src=images/Sketcher_Move.svg style="width:16px"> Move** entry in the Sketch menu
3.  Click on a point or a location in empty space to move the elements to their new location. The existing constraints move as well.
4.  If you want to detach an element and move freely, delete its locking constraints and drag with mouse.
