## Description

This macro is used to create joints of various types, including mortise and tenon joints, box joints, dovetail joints, finger joints (using dovetail type), and a few snap joints, including cantilever, annular, ball, and split types.

## Usage

1.  Select a face and run the macro.
2.  Select the joint type to create. You will then find a parametric joint object with some default property settings, which will need to be modified for your particular needs.

The macro works in [Part Design Workbench](PartDesign_Workbench.md), but also with solids created in any other workbench.

Full documentation can be found on github: [Joint](https://github.com/mwganson/joint).
