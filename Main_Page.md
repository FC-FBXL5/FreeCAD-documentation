# The FreeCAD documentation

  

## Introduction

This is the documentation wiki of [FreeCAD](http://www.freecadweb.org). There are several ways to use this documentation: by exploring the **hubs**, by following the **manual**, or by using the **Help menu** entries from within FreeCAD. This is a work in progress, written by the community of users and developers of FreeCAD. If you find information that is wrong or missing, please [help FreeCAD](Special:MyLanguage/help_FreeCAD.md)! 



## The hubs 

#### <img alt="Crystal_Clear_app_display.png" src=wiki/images/Crystal_Clear_app_display.png  style="width:32px;"> [Users hub](wiki/User_hub.md)
This page contains documentation useful for FreeCAD users in general: a list of all the workbenches, detailed instructions on how to install and use the FreeCAD application, tutorials, and all you need to get started.

#### <img alt="" src=wiki/images/Crystal_Clear_app_terminal.png  style="width:32px;"> [Power users hub](wiki/Power_users_hub.md)

This page gathers documentation for advanced users and people interested in writing python scripts. There you will also find a repository of macros, instructions on how to install and use them, and more information about customizing FreeCAD to your specific needs. 

#### <img alt="" src=wiki/images/Crystal_Clear_app_tutorials.png  style="width:32px;">[Developers hub](wiki/Developer_hub.md)

This section contains material for developers: How to compile FreeCAD yourself, how the FreeCAD source code is structured, how to navigate the source code, how to develop new workbenches, and embed FreeCAD in your own application. 



## Manual

The manual is another, more linear way to present the information contained in this wiki. It is designed to be read like a book, and will gently introduce you to many other pages from the hubs above. [ebook versions](https://www.gitbook.com/book/yorikvanhavre/a-freecad-manual/details) are also available, as well as [a couple of translations in pdf format](https://www.freecadweb.org/manual/). 



## Translations

This documentation is fully translatable by users to other languages, and is in a continuous process of translation. Several partially or fully translated versions of this documentation are available.



## Get involved 

### How to participate 

There is plenty to do inside the FreeCAD project, if you are interested in helping us. Of course, there are programming tasks for C++ or Python programmers, but there are also many things you can do even if you cannot code, such as

-   writing documentation and [editing the wiki](WikiPages.md)
-   helping newcomers
-   translating the application and documentation
-   helping with the packaging of the latest release of FreeCAD for your favourite operating system
-   helping other people around you to discover FreeCAD.

The [help FreeCAD](Special:MyLanguage/help_FreeCAD.md) page describes it all with more details. Starting from 2016, FreeCAD also participates in the [Google Summer of Code](Google_Summer_of_Code.md). The [Contributors hub](wiki/Contributors_hub.md) page is another effort to gather the possible ways to help and contribute to the FreeCAD project.

### Source code 

FreeCAD can be compiled on all platforms using [CMake](https://cmake.org/). The source code is [LGPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU_Lesser_General_Public_License)-licensed and hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/FreeCAD/FreeCAD) and mirrored on [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/freecad/FreeCAD) and [CodeBerg](https://codeberg.org/FreeCAD/FreeCAD). There are build instructions for [Windows](wiki/Compile_on_Windows.md), [Linux](wiki/Compile_on_Linux.md) and [MacOS](wiki/Compile_on_MacOS.md). The source code documentation is [hosted here](http://www.freecadweb.org/api/), generated by [Doxygen](Doxygen.md), and [documented on the wiki](wiki/Source_documentation.md).

### About the development 

Check the [Development roadmap](wiki/Development_roadmap.md) for news about what is being planned, the [Changelog](http://www.freecadweb.org/tracker/changelog_page.php) and [Roadmap](http://www.freecadweb.org/tracker/roadmap_page.php) pages on the [FreeCAD tracker](http://www.freecadweb.org/tracker) to see the progress towards next release, or the [Project statistics](http://www.ohloh.net/p/freecad) for even more information about the FreeCAD codebase. All the development communication happens on the [forum](http://forum.freecadweb.org), so be sure to visit it if you are interested in participating.
